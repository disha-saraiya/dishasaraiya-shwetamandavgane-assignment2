flow for an easy game:
elements- 
board 
reset button
draw 3 buttom

generate27Cards()
-> generates 27 different combinations of color, filling, number for triangle shape. 
-> returns an array 

generateSVGPath(generate27Cards())
-> creates fileStems (SVG files) so that we can populate the cards.
-> splices each card from the 27 cards so that we don't repeat that card on the board
-> returns ONE file path, one by one

generateEasyFilePaths(generate27Cards())
-> takes in the array of 27 cards 
-> for 27 times, generates an SVG path, creates the file path from the PUBLIC folder for the card
-> populates an array with 27 easy file paths. 
-> returns an array that contains the 27 paths. 

easyFilePathArray -> Array that contains the 27 paths of the SVG files in the folder. 

drawEasyCards(numberOfCards,cardArray) 
-> function that draws certain number of cards and pushes it into a card array
-> this is so that we can populate the board with certain number of cards
-> for a new game, we need to populate with 12 cards
-> for every draw button press, we need to fill 3 more cards from THAT deck of cards. 
-> we need to keep drawing from the same deck till the deck is empty. 



FOR A NEW EASY GAME: 
we need to show 12 cards on the board. 
currentCardsOnEasyBoard => 12 newly drawn cards from the set of 27 cards in total. 
-> we can use the drawEasyCards function to draw 12 cards INTO a new array. 

use a variable firstTimeEasyArray -> [] and use this to keep drawing and populating the board for one game 
therefore call drawEasyCards(12, firstTimeEasyArray); 
after this is called, 

FOR DRAWING 3 cards FROM AN EXISTING EASY GAME: 
we need to draw the cards from the remainder of the cards AFTER the first call is done. (for a new game)
-> use the drawEasyCards function to draw 3 cards from the leftover. 

therefore call drawEasyCards(3, firstTimeEasyArray)

keep drawing three cards till all 27 are on board, and then display a message. 

FOR RESETTING AN EASY GAME
we need to show 12 NEW cards on the board. so this is like creating a new game altogether
we need to draw 12 new cards, hence we can use an empty array?
